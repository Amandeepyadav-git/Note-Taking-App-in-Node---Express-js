This is a simple file-based Task Manager built using Node.js, Express, and EJS. It allows users to create, store, and view tasks locally using the file system instead of a database. Each task is saved as a text file inside the /files directory, where the task title becomes the file name and the task details are stored as file content.

The project uses EJS for server-side rendering, Express for handling routes, and Node’s fs module to perform file operations like creating and reading tasks. The goal of this mini project is to help beginners understand how backend logic interacts with file handling and form submissions in a simple web app.

THings I learned in this project:

- How to take input from the front-end,
- How to use anchor tags to move along different pages,
- How to use routes to make shifting to pages so easy,
- Handling submission of tasks,
- Saving the projects as files without DATABASE,
- Use of (<%= %>) EJS tags,
- And also some JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS like-
    - .render()
    - .readFIle()
    - .readdire()
    - .urlEncoded()
    - .static()
    - .readFile()
    - .redirect()
You can add new tasks using the form, and they’ll appear dynamically on the home page after creation. This project serves as a foundational step toward building dynamic full-stack applications.

Whoever reading this, I hope you best of luck for your future and Keep learning consistently! :)
